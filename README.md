# Form
 Forms in HTML collect user input. They use various elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons. The `<form>` tag wraps all form elements and typically includes `action` (URL for form data) and `method` (HTTP method, usually "GET" or "POST").  Key elements include: 
 1. **Text Input** (`<input type="text">`): Single-line text entry.
 2. **Password Input** (`<input type="password">`): Text entry with hidden characters.
 3. **Radio Buttons** (`<input type="radio">`): Select one option from a group.
 4. **Checkboxes** (`<input type="checkbox">`): Select multiple options.
 5. **Submit Button** (`<input type="submit">`): Submits the form data. 
 6. **Textarea** (`<textarea>`): Multi-line text entry. 
 7. **Select Box** (`<select>`): Drop-down list.  Labels (`<label>`) improve accessibility, and `<fieldset>` with `<legend>` groups related elements. Forms are essential for user interaction and data collection on websites.
